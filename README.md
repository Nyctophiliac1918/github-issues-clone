# Github issues page clone

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running locally

Change the values of `REPO_OWNER` and `REPO_NAME` at `src/utilities/constants.js` to get the issuess of a different repository.
Couldn't find a way to show the number of currently closed issues. Therefore, hardcoded it, change `OPEN` and `CLOSED` values too at `src/utilities/constants.js`.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
